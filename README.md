### A Game Employing ARKit to Move Tiles Using Head Movement

The screen clears, and in its place appears a tiled puzzle which is built with one tile missing and the others mixed up
You have a few seconds to look at the puzzle before the cursor appears.
This specialized cursor will start at the middle of the screen and by tilting your head you can make it move.

### Object of the Game
The goal  is to move all the tiles to their correct location to form the original picture.
This is done by imagining you are "pointing your nose" at the tile you want to move to the open/empty space.
Do this repeatedly until the tiles have all returned to their original locations

### End of the Game
Confetti will fall when the puzzle is complete.
Double-tap to return/select a new puzzle

### How It Works
