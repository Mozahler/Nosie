## Instructions...

Oops!!
I turned off the help screens to take some automated photos for the App Store, and forgot to turn them back on...

Long Press on any white area to bring up settings.
There you'll find the settings you can change.
Turn on **help** by tapping on that row and tapping on "ON"
You'll need to restart the app to see help. 

When on the Puzzle Page you can return to the carousel by double-tapping any of the white space.

iPads do not have the cameras needed for hands-free play.  You have to tap the tile you want to move.

## With Magic Tiles!

Tilt your head to aim your nose at a tile and it will move!

**Solve a tile puzzle**
 
 Aim your nose at the tile you want to move and watch it slide into the empty space.
 Repeat until you've solved the puzzle.
 
 
### A Game Employing ARKit to Move Tiles Using Head Movement

The screen clears, and in its place appears a tiled puzzle which is built with one tile missing and the others mixed up
You have a few seconds to look at the puzzle before the cursor appears.
This specialized cursor will start at the middle of the screen and by tilting your head you can make it move.

### Object of the Game
The goal  is to move all the tiles to their correct location to form the original picture.
This is done by imagining you are "pointing your nose" at the tile you want to move to the open/empty space.
Do this repeatedly until the tiles have all returned to their original locations

### End of the Game
Confetti will fall when the puzzle is complete.
Double-tap to return/select a new puzzle

### How It Works
A Carousel of Images Is Presented on the opening screen/display
Navigate (move the cursor) by moving your head "aim at a tile with your nose"

### Hardware Required

For hands-free play, you need a device that has the specialized front facing cameras needed to calculate distance/movement.
iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max  or newer

Will run on all iPhones and iPads
The app will automatically switch to manual mode if it can't enable the appropriate hardware.
Simply tap on the tile you wish to move.

## Privacy Policy

**No information is shared in any way to any third party.**

During play, the selfie cameras take a video of the user. The video stream is analyzed to gauge the rotation of the user’s head while playing. This data is used to place a cursor at the spot on the screen it thinks is being looked at and a cursor is drawn using SceneKit and Sprites. The data is not saved to disk (or anywhere else) — it is immediately discarded. Only documented API calls to SceneKit and ARKit are used.
**The video stream is analyzed live and not stored to disk.**
**The data is never stored in any form and cannot be shared.**
